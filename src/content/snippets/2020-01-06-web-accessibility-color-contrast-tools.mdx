- [A11y - Color Contrast Checker](https://www.figma.com/c/plugin/733159460536249875/A11y---Color-Contrast-Checker) is my top pick. This is a Figma plugin that checks an entire frame for contrast issues.
- [Able](https://www.figma.com/c/plugin/734693888346260052/Able-%E2%80%93-Friction-free-accessibility) Figma plugin that automatically checks conrast while you have two layers selected.
- [Stark](https://www.figma.com/c/plugin/732603254453395948/Stark) is another Figma plugin that does both contrast checking and color blind simulation.
- [WebAIM](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) has an in browser contrast checker.
