When using an `a` tag with `target='_blank'`, it is important to include the attribbute `rel='noreferrer noopener'` to protect yourself from security risks.


This article, ["About rel=noopener,"](https://mathiasbynens.github.io/rel-noopener/) by [Mathias Bynens](http://github.com/mathiasbynens) explains why.


This [ESlint rule](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react/blob/master/docs/rules/jsx-no-target-blank.md) helps prevent accidentally forgetting to include the attribute in your JSX projects.
