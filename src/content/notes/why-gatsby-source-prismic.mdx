This note provides extra context on the tutorial [Create a Prismic powered Gatsby site from scratch](/create-a-prismic-gatsby-site).

At the time of my writing (Wednesday, June 10th 2020), there are two Gatsby plugins for sourcing your Prismic data.

- [gatsby-source-prismic-graphql](https://github.com/birkir/gatsby-source-prismic-graphql)
- [gatsby-source-prismic](https://github.com/angeloashmore/gatsby-source-prismic)

I chose to use `gatsby-source-prismic`.

There are pros and cons to each of these source plugins. (This issue)[https://github.com/angeloashmore/gatsby-source-prismic/issues/217] and the comments within give a great overview of the current state of things.

I chose `gatsby-source-prismic` because it is lightweight (creating pages are not a feature of this plugin) and appears to have a better developer experience (I formed this opinion based on some light reading through each repo's issues). I anticiapte these plugins changing and will revisit this decision in the future.
