Using next gen image formats like [WebP](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp) is a great way to improve your app's performance by drastically reducing the file size of your images.

This snippet from my React boilerplate, [Nova](https://nova.yawnch.com), demonstrates implementing WebP images that fallsback to png/jpg in the case the user's browser does not support it.

```jsx
<picture>
  <source srcSet={globeWebp} type='image/webp' />
  <source srcSet={globe} type='image/png' />
  <img src={globe} alt='An illustration of a planet-like sphere' />
</picture>
```

## Browser support

[Can I Use: WebP](https://caniuse.com/#feat=webp)

[Can I Use: JPEG 2000](https://caniuse.com/#feat=jpeg2000)

## Tools to create or convert WebP Images

- [Node Module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/imagemin-webp)
- [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/docs/exporting/#exporting)
- [PhotoShop Plugin](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/webpshop)
- In browser: [webp-converter](https://webp-converter.com/) or [online-convert](https://www.online-convert.com/)

## Ways to improve this implementation

- Create a reusable React component that takes the image paths and alt text as props.
- Support JPEG 2000
