## Specify client paths

https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-create-client-paths/

`npm i gatsby-plugin-create-client-paths`

All urls that match `/post/*` will render the `pages/post.js` component.

`gatsby-config.js`
```
{
  resolve: `gatsby-plugin-create-client-paths`,
  options: { prefixes: [`/post/*`] },
},
```

## Setup Netlify redirect

This will work, however in production your 404 page will flash for a moment before the client side route takes over. To fix this, setup a redirect.

See [this issue](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/3420) for further context.

In `netlify.toml`

```
[[redirects]]
  from = "/post/*"
  to = "/post"
  status = 200
  force = true
```

## Conclusion

By specifying which routes should be client rendered, and setting up the appropriate redirects, Gatsby routing can be used in much the same way a traditional Single Page App would be.
