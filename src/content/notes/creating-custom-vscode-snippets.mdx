When I find myself copying and pasting boilerplate code, I create a snippet to help me code faster.

![Create a global snippets file](/images/posts/customSnippets/custom-vscode-snippets-1.gif)

Create a global snippets file. 

- `Code > Preferences > User Snippets`
- New Global Snippets File...
- Name your file and press `ENTER`

![Define and use your snippet](/images/posts/customSnippets/custom-vscode-snippets-2.gif)

Define your snippet and start using it!

- In this example, we're creating a simple React component snippet.
  ```json
    // snippets.code-snippets

    {
      "ReactComponent": {
        "prefix": "component",
        "scope": "javascript",
        "body": [
          "import React from 'react'",
          "",
          "export default props => {",
          "  return <div>New Function Component</div>",
          "}"
        ],
        "description": "Create a React component"
      }
    }
  ```
- Save (`CMD+S`) the `snippets.code-snippets` file.
- Open a JavaScript file (this file type is determined by the `scope` key).
- Type your defined prefix and press `TAB`.
- See your snippet appear.
