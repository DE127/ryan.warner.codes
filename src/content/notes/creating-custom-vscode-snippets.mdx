When I find myself copying and pasting boilerplate code, I create a snippet to help me code faster.

Create a global snippets file. 

- `Code -> Preferences -> User Snippets`
- New Global Snippets File...
- Name your file and press enter

Define your snippet, save, and start using it!

- Type your defined prefix, and press tab.
- See your snippet appear.
