By using VSCode to write commits, I don't have to tab over to terminal. It also makes it much easier to write multiline commits.

Need to find a key command for staging, or somehow bundle it with `CMD+G`?

Maybe there's a quick way to write multiline commits in iTerm2 as well. I'll have to look into that.

To make it even faster, use keybaord shortcuts. The default keyboard shortcut for opening source control is `CTRL+SHIFT+G` on a Mac. I changed this to `CMD+G` which I find easier to remember and use.
