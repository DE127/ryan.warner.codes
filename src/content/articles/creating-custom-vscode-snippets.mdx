import Video from 'components/Video/Video'

When I find myself copying and pasting boilerplate code, I create a snippet to help me work faster.

<Video

/>

Create a global snippets file.

- `Code > Preferences > User Snippets`
- New Global Snippets File...
- Name your file and press `ENTER`

Define your snippet and start using it!

- In this example, we're creating a simple React component snippet.

  ```json
  // snippets.code-snippets

  {
    "ReactComponent": {
      "prefix": "component",
      "scope": "javascript",
      "body": [
        "import React from 'react'",
        "",
        "export default props => {",
        "  return <div>New Function Component</div>",
        "}"
      ],
      "description": "Create a React component"
    }
  }
  ```

* Save (`CMD+S`) the `snippets.code-snippets` file.
* Open a JavaScript file (this file type is determined by the `scope` key).
* Type your defined prefix and press `TAB`.
* See your snippet appear.
