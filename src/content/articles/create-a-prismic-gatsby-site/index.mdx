## Getting started with Prismic

[Prismic](https://prismic.io/) is a headless content management system.

### Create a Prismic account

The first step is to create a Prismic account. Navigate to [prismic.io](https://prismic.io/) and click "Create a Project" in the top right.

Fill out the sign up form and click "Create Account".

### Create a new repository

A Prismic repository is where your content will be stored. Click "Create repository" in the top right.

Choose a unique repository name, select your plan (I'm using the single user free plan) and click "Create this repository" at the bottom.

## Create a custom type
  - Add title
  - Slug
  - Image

## Create some sample post content

## Create a new Gatsby site

Install the Gatsby CLI and use it to initialize a new Gatsby site with the [default starter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default). These steps are adapted from the official [Gatsby Quick Start](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/quick-start).

```bash
npm install -g gatsby-cli
gatsby new gatsby-site
cd gatsby-site
npm start
```

You should see the site running at [`localhost:8000`](http://localhost:8000).

## Set up gatsby-source-prismic

[Read my reasoning behind choosing this package](/why-gatsby-source-prismic).

The following instructions are adapted and simplified version of the [official documentation](https://github.com/angeloashmore/gatsby-source-prismic).

Install the package

`npm install --save gatsby-source-prismic`

Add the plugin to your Gatsby plugins array.

<AddPlugin />

There are a lot more options available (see the full list [in the docs](https://github.com/angeloashmore/gatsby-source-prismic#how-to-use)) but we're going to start simple.

The schema definition does not yet exist in our code base. To add this, create the file `src/schemas/post.json`.

Grab the JSON genereted by Prismic by navigating to your custom `post` type, and then click on the "JSON editor" tab on the right.

![Prismic JSON editor](./images/prismic-json-editor.png)

Copy and paste this JSON into your `src/schemas/post.json` file.

Restart your development server.

## View your Prismic content in the GraphQL explorer

Open the GraphQL explorer ([http://localhost:8000/___graphq](http://localhost:8000/___graphq) to see your Prismic post content! Expand `allPrismicPost → edges → data → title → text` and press the Execute Query (play) button (CTRL + Enter) to see the post content you entered in the Prismic UI.
