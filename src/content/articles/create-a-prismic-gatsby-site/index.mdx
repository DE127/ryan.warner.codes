## Getting started with Prismic

[Prismic](https://prismic.io/) is a headless content management system.

### Create a Prismic account

The first step is to create a Prismic account. Navigate to [prismic.io](https://prismic.io/) and click "Create a Project" in the top right.

Fill out the form and click "Create Account".

### Create a new repository

A Prismic repository is where your content will be stored. Click "Create repository" in the top right.

Choose a unique repository name, select your plan (I'm using the single user free plan) and click "Create this repository" at the bottom.

## Create a custom type
  - Add title
  - Slug
  - Image

## Initialize a new, default Gatsby site

Install the Gatsby CLI and use it to initialize a new Gatsby site with the [default starter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default). These steps are adapted from the official [Gatsby Quick Start](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/quick-start).

```bash
npm install -g gatsby-cli
gatsby new gatsby-site
cd gatsby-site
npm start
```

You should see the site running at [`localhost:8000`](http://localhost:8000).

## Choose a Prismic data source plugin

At the time of my writing (Wednesday, June 10th 2020), there are two Gatsby plugins for sourcing your Prismic data.

- [gatsby-source-prismic-graphql](https://github.com/birkir/gatsby-source-prismic-graphql)
- [gatsby-source-prismic](https://github.com/angeloashmore/gatsby-source-prismic)

In this tutorial, we are going to use `gatsby-source-prismic`.

There are pros and cons to each of these source plugins. (This issue)[https://github.com/angeloashmore/gatsby-source-prismic/issues/217] and the comments within give a great overview of the current state of things.

I chose `gatsby-source-prismic` because it is lightweight (creating pages are not a feature of this plugin) and appears to have less developer experience issues (I formed this opinion based on some light reading through each repo's issues). I anticiapte these plugins changing and will revisit this tutorial in the future.
