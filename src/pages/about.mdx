# About

I specialize in rapidly building software companies and web applications. I use an entrepreneurial mindset to inform my design and engineering output.

I prioritize communication while building. I am an excellent communicator, both written and verbal. I use screen casts, video calls, and written words to lead teams built on trust and transparency.

I am an expert in JavaScript, working primarily in React and Firebase, but I have experience working in a wide range of technologies including Node & Express, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, React Native, Gatsby, REST API design, CircleCI, 3rd party APIs (Stripe, Discord, Slack, Amplitude, Google Auth, etc.), AWS (S3, CloudFront, Cognito, Build Pipeline, Route53, ACM), and many more.

Additionally, I am an experienced interface and user experience designer. I use Figma to communicate ideas through low and high fidelity mockups, design systems, and clickable prototypes.

## Outside of software dev

- I’ve been a gamer my entire life. I play StarCraft, Fortnite, and Nintendo 64.

- I ran Division 3 track (400m) at Rochester Institute of Technology, and still hold school records to this day.

- I play guitar and bass, and I’m learning to record my own songs.

- I collect video games and action figures, and love SciFi.
