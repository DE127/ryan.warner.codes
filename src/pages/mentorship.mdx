# Mentorship

I believe it's extremely important to always have a mentor and to always be mentoring â€” always be learning, and always be teaching. I learn just as much mentoring, as I do receiving guidance from my own mentors.

That being said, I would love to mentor you in your journey building web apps. In the form of 30-60 minute one-on-one video calls, I will share my knowledge and expertise in JavaScript, React, and building production-ready web applications. We can create a learning plan, debug your side project, or just chat about anything you'd like.

This 1:1 mentoring is completely free. No catch. What do I get out of it? I bet you'll teach me something I didn't know or nudge me to brush up on a topic. As a remote worker, it also helps me stay social.

If this sounds like something you're interested in, send me an email at [warner.ryan@gmail.com](mailto:ryan@warner.codes?subject=Hey!%20I'm%20interested%20in%20mentorship.).
