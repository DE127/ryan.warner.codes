# Mentorship

I believe it's extremely important to have a mentor and to be mentoring â€” always be learning, and always be teaching. I learn just as much mentoring as I do receiving guidance from my mentors.

That being said, I would love to mentor you in your journey building web apps. In the form of 30-60 minute one-on-one video calls, I will share my knowledge and expertise in React, design, and building production-ready web applications. We can set goals, debug your side project, or chat about anything you'd like.

This 1:1 mentoring is completely free. No catch. I enjoy teaching and I want to become a better teacher. I'm inspired by other passionate developers who are excited to learn and improve. I'm a remote worker and it's important to stay social.

If this sounds like something you're interested in, send me an email at [ryan@warner.codes](mailto:ryan@warner.codes?subject=Hey!%20I'm%20interested%20in%20mentorship.).
