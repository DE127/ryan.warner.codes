# Tools Ryan uses

## Coding and design tools

- I use [VSCode](visualstudio.com) with the [Gruvbox Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tomphilbin.gruvbox-themes) for writing code.
- My preferred terminal is [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) with [Itermocil](https://github.com/TomAnthony/itermocil).
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) has fundamentally changed the way I design on teams.

## Apps

- I take notes using [Notion](https://www.notion.so/).
- [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) has provided a lot of value to my teams and I when creating APIs.
- [IconJar](https://geticonjar.com/) helps me keep my SVG assets organized.
- [Vanilla](https://matthewpalmer.net/vanilla/) - "Hide menu bar icons on your Mac."

## Equipment

- I use a 15-inch 2017 MacBook Pro, Magic Mouse, and Magic Keyboard.
- My mic is a [Rode Podcastor](http://www.rode.com/microphones/podcaster).
- I sit for way too long in a Herman Miller Aeron Size B. A good chair is something I don't compromise on.
- My second screen is a [Dell UltraSharp U2715H 27-Inch](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00P0EQD1Q/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1). It's alright.
- For gaming, I use a [DREVO Excalibur 84-Key Cherry MX](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N6GBUQE/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) keyboard and [Final Mouse](https://finalmouse.com/products/air-blue?variant=9835888050212).
