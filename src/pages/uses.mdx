# Tools Ryan uses

## Equipment

- I use a 15-inch 2017 MacBook Pro, Magic Mouse, and Magic Keyboard. My laptop sits on the [mStand by Rain Design](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OOYECC/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ryanwarner03-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B000OOYECC&linkId=356fdcae3316396fe72e3a88c9df1860).
- My mic is a [Rode Podcaster](https://amzn.to/2Q1l35T). It sits in the [Rode PSM1 Shock Mount](http://www.rode.com/accessories/psm1), attached to the [Rode PSA1 Boom Arm](http://www.rode.com/accessories/psa1).
- I sit for way too long in a Herman Miller Aeron Size B. A good chair is something I don't compromise on.
- My light is an [Elgato Key Light](https://www.elgato.com/en/gaming/key-light). Pictured is a [Neewer CN-160](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004TJ6JH6/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ryanwarner03-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B004TJ6JH6&linkId=2bd76f15ec85594f4117b639602e73df) but I have since upgraded.
- My second screen is a [Dell UltraSharp U2715H 27-Inch](https://amzn.to/3l0K4MS). It's alright.
- My mouse / desk pad is the [SteelSeries QcK Gaming Surface - XXL Thick Cloth](https://amzn.to/3g6sDXu).
- For gaming, I use a [DREVO Excalibur 84-Key Cherry MX](https://amzn.to/3g9kQIv).
- My desk is a [Varidesk 60" Electric](https://amzn.to/2DV0t4L) standing desk.

## Coding and design tools

- I use [VSCode](visualstudio.com) with the [Gruvbox Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tomphilbin.gruvbox-themes) for writing code.
- My preferred terminal is [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) with [Itermocil](https://github.com/TomAnthony/itermocil).
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) has fundamentally changed the way I design on teams.

## Productivity Apps

- I take notes using [Notion](https://www.notion.so/).
- [CloudApp](https://www.getcloudapp.com/) helps me visually communicate what's on my screen.
- [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) has provided a lot of value to my teams and I when creating APIs.
- [IconJar](https://geticonjar.com/) helps me keep my SVG assets organized.
- [Vanilla](https://matthewpalmer.net/vanilla/) - "Hide menu bar icons on your Mac."
- [FontPlop] - "fontplop is an OSX/macOS application which takes ttf and otf files and outputs a webfont bundle"
